      <p  style="color: black;">A single sofa takes up 300 to 600 hours of skilled labor to make.
         Even small companies and individuals avail themselves of power saws
          and other motorized machinery, yet specialized hand tools are still applied to detail work.
           These include the regulator for stuffing, the "ripping tool," and a type of pliers called diagonal cutters.
           Sofas come in three major sizes. The full sofa is 84 in (2.13 m) wide. Smaller versions like the two-seater and love seat 
           range between 60-80 in (1.52-2.03 m). Variations on the standard sofa include modular items and sofas with special uses such as daybeds
            or convertible sofa beds. Ornamental designs are not necessarily less durable, but they do not invite casual use.

      <p><li>1 First the frame is constructed from wood that has been found clear of any defects.<br>
         The thickness of the wood should allow for the heavy tension webbing to follow. <br>
         If the frame is not sufficiently strong, it will not bear the weight redistributed
          into it by the webbing whenever someone sits down. Arms, back, or back sections, seat,
           and legs are attached. The preferred method is with clean-cut, fitted double doweled glue
            joints reinforced with comer braces, glued and also screwed into place. Each major part of 
            the sofa will have to have springs attached separately, and also be padded separately. Consequently,
             they are "framed out" with reinforcing slats, arranged around the seat section.
